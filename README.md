# CstyleX-installer
.sh installer for the sentora CstyleX theme

I didn't find a one line installer for the CstyleX theme. So I dicided to create one (actually modify a existing one). 

Code source: zppy.github.io/zentora_installer.sh


# How to install

Run the following line:
"bash <(curl -L -Ss https://github.com/thtauhid/CstyleX-installer/raw/master/installer.sh)"
